# Ad-hoc sign inside-out (extension first, then app) so the IPA ships with a COMPLETE, well-formed
# nested signature structure: the app's CodeResources seals the appex's cdhash, and every Mach-O has a
# real signature slot. Re-signers (Sideloadly/AltStore) then just *replace* that structure with the
# user's Apple ID — a `codesign --force` over an existing signature is reliable. Shipping fully unsigned
# instead forces the re-signer to *synthesize* the nested appex seal from nothing, which Sideloadly does
# wrong → the appex's on-disk pages don't match its seal → the kernel SIGKILLs it at launch with
# "CODESIGNING / Invalid Page" (the broadcast extension dies instantly, dash stays blank).
