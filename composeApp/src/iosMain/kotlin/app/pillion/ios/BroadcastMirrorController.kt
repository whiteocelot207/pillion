/**
 * Backs the Pillion "Start mirroring" button on iOS with the ReplayKit Broadcast Upload Extension.
 *
 * iOS can only mirror the *whole* screen (any app, e.g. Waze) from a broadcast extension, which runs
 * out of process and keeps going while Pillion is backgrounded. So this controller doesn't stream
 * itself: [start]/[stop] just trigger the system broadcast picker — the Swift shell injects that as
 * [onToggle] — and the extension does the capture + NaviLite streaming. The extension posts Darwin
 * notifications on start/finish, which the Swift shell relays here via [setActive] so the shared UI
 * reflects live state without the app needing the extension's fps.
